# milkjam
The environment for testing cryptocurrency trading algorithms.

This is a descendant of [Distonx](https://github.com/Markfryazino/Distonx) project, where we tried to train a neural network for trading on Binance. In Milkjam I am building an environment to test such algorithms. Eventually Milkjam is planned to be a Django website, providing API to register and validate models.
